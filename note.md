Implement a professional, RAG-powered chatbot for my portfolio website, featuring a floating chat interface positioned in the bottom-left corner. The system must
utilize a vector database such as Qdrant, Chroma, or Supabase Vector to store and retrieve information from both the website's text content and an uploaded PDF
resume. Use a framework like LangChain paired with an LLM like GPT-5.2-nano to enable the bot to act as a recruitment assistant, providing prospective employers with
accurate, context-aware answers regarding my technical skills, project details, and professional experience.

The implementation should include the frontend UI
components, a backend API for handling queries, and a data ingestion script for processing the resume and site content into embeddings.
